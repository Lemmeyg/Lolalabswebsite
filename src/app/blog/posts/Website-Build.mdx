# Exploring AI - What Can I Learn from One Week of AI Building?

I have spent a lot of time recently learning about and working with AI and ensure my time was well spent, I challenged myself to build a variety of AI applications, each within a week. My first projectâ€”a website that documents my workâ€”taught me that the process is not as easy as it seems but led to some valuable lessons learned along the way. Check out my website for details on utilizing AI; and some of the projects I have completed so far. Hopefully, you'll see the versatility of this tool and be inspired to tackle your own challenges.

## Project Overview: Building My First Website

For my first project, I used a template from the Vercel template pages and utilized Cursor to edit the site and update it with new content. I built an agent for creating project pages that adhered to both page and file formats, saving me about an hour on each page (as I'm not the best writer). It is obviously a process of iteration but I pivoted from previous attempts at similar tools by having it engage me in a 'conversation' and act as almost an editor instead of trying to get it to write 100% for me.

## Challenges Faced and Lessons Learned

When it came to editing the website template Cursor wasn't initially familiar with the site structure, which led to some difficulties in making changes. The most significant challenge was integrating the Vapi widget (voice agent) into the header. This experience highlighted that white these tools are good at producing working code, a solid understanding of architecture is crucial when using AI coding tools effectively.

## The Importance of Hands-On Experience

Building these AI projects has been enjoyable as well as frustrating, but the power and impact of AI as a tool is clear. Like any tool, learning how to use it effectively is key. Personally, so far using these tools been eye-opening and reinforced the idea that hands-on experience is the best form of learning.

## Next Up

As I continue to build with AII, I hope others will see the value I get from it and feel motivated to try and solve their own real world real-world challenges. Check out my completed website project, where you'll find (not just the website but also..)details about the things I've built so far. Stay tuned for what's next - I am not sure but open to ideas, and feel free to reach out with any questions or share your own experiences.
